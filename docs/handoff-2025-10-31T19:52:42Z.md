## ðŸŽ¯ Build Runner Governance Requirements

You MUST follow Build Runner governance protocols:

1. **Update state after every task**: Use `.runner/scripts/update-task-completion.sh "task description" [step_increment]`
2. **Keep documentation synchronized**: Update both root and docs/ files
3. **Maintain Change History**: Add entries to spec file with date, phase, step
4. **Commit frequently**: Don't lose work, commit after each significant task
5. **Use br-handoff**: Generate handoff docs for session transitions
