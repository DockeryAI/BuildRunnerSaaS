## ðŸŽ¯ BUILD RUNNER GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS

You MUST follow Build Runner governance protocols:

1. **Auto-calculate progress**: Use `.runner/scripts/auto-calculate-progress.sh` to update phases/steps based on actual completion
2. **Update after every task**: Use `.runner/scripts/update-task-completion.sh "task description"` to add completed work
3. **Keep documentation synchronized**: Update both root and docs/ files
4. **Maintain Change History**: Add entries to spec file with date and completed tasks
5. **Commit frequently**: Don't lose work, commit after each significant task
6. **Use smart handoff**: Use `.runner/scripts/smart-handoff.sh` for session transitions
